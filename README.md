# OVR
OVR is a project of Web application software allowing to put in relation of the sportsmen practising the MOUNTAIN BIKE. The principle is inspired by BlablaCar : a person proposes a ride MOUNTAIN BIKE by indicating the course on an available map since the site. Once validated, sportsmen can then join this event or an other one according to the level of difficulty, localization or still of the type of practised MOUNTAIN BIKE.
